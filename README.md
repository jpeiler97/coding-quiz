# coding-quiz

For this assignment I was to make a Javascript quiz from scratch. Though using jQuery would have been useful, the purpose of this assignment was to utitilize what I knew about basic Javascipt alone. To begin structuring my code I made sure I had most of the HTML and CSS I needed first, then moved on to my script file. First I made sure I had whatever buttons I needed selected in query selectors, then moved on to the basic functions like startGame() and worked out of that. Though this was a simple 10 question quiz, I feel like this assignment helped me a lot with figuring out just where to start and how to plan out my code.
